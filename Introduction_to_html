HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, 
is the standard markup language used to
create and design web pages.
It forms the backbone of the World Wide Web,
enabling the creation and formatting of documents that can be viewed on the internet by
web browsers.
HTML documents are comprised of a series of elements, 
which are enclosed within 
angle brackets, known as tags.
These tags define the structure and content of the document.
