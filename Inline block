Inline elements: Inline elements occupy only enough width that is sufficient to it and allows other elements next to it which are inline. Inline elements don’t start from a new line and don’t have top and bottom margins as block elements have.

Examples of Inline elements:

<a>: This tag is used for including hyperlinks in the webpage.
<br>: This tag is used for mentioning line breaks in the webpage wherever needed.
<script> : This tag is used for including external and internal JavaScript codes.
<input>: This tag is used for taking input from the users and is mainly used in forms.
<img>: This tag is used for including different images in the webpage to add beauty to the webpage.
<span>:  This is an inline container that takes necessary space only.
<b>:  This tag is used in places where bold text is needed.
<label>: The tag in HTML is used to provide a usability improvement for mouse users i.e, if a user clicks on the text within the <label> element, it toggles the control.
